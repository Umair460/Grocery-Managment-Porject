A comprehensive web application for managing grocery inventories. This project leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for the frontend, Python for the backend, and MySQL for the database.

Python: Ensure Python is installed. We recommend using VS Code or PyCharm for running the backend code.
Setup Instructions
Database Setup:

Download and install MySQL.
Locate the pycache folder in the repository.
Inside pycache, find the database folder. Import the .sql files from this folder into your MySQL database.
Backend Setup:

Open the backend folder in VS Code or PyCharm.
Ensure all necessary Python packages are installed. You can use a requirements.txt file if provided.
Keep all Python files in the same folder.
Run the main file to start the backend server.
Frontend Setup:

Open the index.html file in your web browser to visualize the frontend.
Ensure the frontend files are properly linked to the backend for full functionality.
Usage
Frontend: The index.html file provides the user interface.
